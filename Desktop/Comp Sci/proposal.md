# Proposal

Bubble Blower Jetstream

TODO

The project is going to be based on the game jetpack joyride which I played as a child.

TODO

IM going to try building this on pygames and within the game we are going to apply gravity and obstacles as well as potential power ups. May be a coin or currency system that can be used to by power ups.

TODO

I do not have plans to combine this project with a project from another course.

A game similar to jetpack joyride as in it is a side-scrolling endless runner action video game where it generates obstacles that immediately end the run and set highscores.

I think I could probably make a functional game that meets what I expect it to do.

I hope to accomplish my first ever game regardless of similarities to a game that has already seen much success. I do believe that I have seen many copies of many different games regardless of how small the platform is.

TODO

I will need the skills and knowledge of programming used to make a video game and more specifically a side runner. I will need to research a little bit more about gravity 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
