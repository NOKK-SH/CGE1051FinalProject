# Proposal

RocketRider Jetstream Obstacle Dodger


The project is going to be based on the game jetpack joyride which I played as a child.


We are going to try building this on pygames and within the game we are going to apply gravity and obstacles as well as potential power ups. May be a coin or currency system that can be used to buy power ups.

I do not have plans to combine this project with a project from another course.

A likly and acomplishable game is a game similar to jetpack joyride as in it is a side-scrolling endless runner action video game where it generates obstacles that immediately end the run and set highscores.

I hope to accomplish my first ever game regardless of similarities to a game that has already seen much success. I do believe that I have seen many copies of many different games regardless of how small the platform is.


I will need the skills and knowledge of programming used to make a video game and more specifically a side runner. I will need to research a little bit more about gravity in videogames
